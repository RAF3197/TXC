<h1>Asynchronous Transfer Mode Overview</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is a technology that has the
potential of revolutionizing data communications and
telecommunications.  Based on the emerging standards for
Broadband Integrated Services Digital Networks (B-ISDN), ATM
offers the economically sound "bandwidth on demand" features of
packet-switching technology at the high speeds required for
today's LAN and WAN networks -- and tomorrow's.
</p><p>
ATM is a cell-relay technology that divides upper-level data
units into 53-byte cells for transmission over the physical
medium.  It operates independently of the type of transmission
being generated at the upper layers AND of the type and speed of
the physical-layer medium below it.
</p><p>
This allows the ATM technology to transport all kinds of
transmissions (e.g, data, voice, video, etc.) in a single
integrated data stream over any medium, ranging from existing
T1/E1 lines, to SONET OC-3 at speeds of 155 Mbps, and beyond.
</p><p>
</p><h2>ATM Standards</h2>
<p>
The following are some of the basic ATM standards documents available
from the
<a href="http://www.itu.int/">International Telecommunications Union (ITU)</a>.
</p><p>
</p><dl>
<dt>ITU-T I.361
</dt><dd>Defines the ATM Layer functions.
</dd><dt>ITU-T I.363
</dt><dd>Defines the ATM Adaptation Layer protocols.
</dd><dt>ITU-T I.610
</dt><dd>Defines the ATM Operation and Maintenance (OAM) functions.
</dd></dl>
<p>
</p><h2>The ATM Network</h2>
<p>
The technology allows both public (i.e., RBOC or carrier) and
private (i.e., LAN or LAN-to-internal switch) ATM networks.
This capability gives a seamless and transparent (to the user)
connection from one end user to another end user, whether in the
same building or across two continents.  The basic network
structure is as shown on the following page.

</pre>
<p>
Three types of interfaces exist in this diagram:
</p><ol>
<li>User-to-Network Interface (UNI)
</li><li>Network-to-Network Interface (NNI)
</li><li>Inter-Carrier Interface (ICI)
</li></ol>
<p>
The UNI exists between a single end user and a public ATM
network, between a single end user and a private ATM switch, or
between a private ATM switch and the public ATM network of an
RBOC.
</p><p>
The NNI exists between switches in a single public ATM
network.  NNIs may also exist between two private ATM switches.
</p><p>
The ICI is located between two public ATM networks (an RBOC and
an interexchange carrier).
</p><p>
All of these interfaces are very similar.  The major differences
between these types of interfaces are administrative and
signalling related.  The only type of signalling exchanged
across the UNI is that required to set up a VIRTUAL CHANNEL for
the transmission.
</p><p>
Communication across the NNI and the ICI will require
signalling for virtual-path and virtual-channel establishment
together with various exchange mechanisms for the exchange of
information such as routing tables, etc.
</p><p>
The network functions as follows:  End User 1 in Chicago wishes
to transfer a data file to End User 2 in Los Angeles.  A virtual
channel is created and a virtual path is established from switch
to switch within the public ATM network in Chicago (ATM Network
1).  The Chicago RBOC, in turn, establishes contact with the
public ATM network in Los Angeles (ATM Network 2).
</p><p>
ATM Network 2 also establishes a virtual path from switch to
switch within the network and with the Private ATM Switch at the
destination.  The private ATM network completes the virtual
path by establishing a virtual channel with End User 2.
</p><p>
At each interface in this network, a unique virtual path
identifier (VPI) and virtual channel identifier (VCI) are
established for this transmission.  These identifiers are of
local significance ONLY:  the identifier is significant only for
a specific switch and the two nodes adjacent to it in the
virtual path.  Each node within the virtual path (including both
the end users and the switches) maintain a pool of inactive
identifiers to be used as needed.
</p><p>
End User 2 encapsulates the file in 53-byte cells, each with its
unique VPI/VCI "destination address" in the header.  These cells
are streamed and sent across the UNI to the ATM network switch.
This switch reads the ATM header, consults the routing table
created during the virtual path setup, changes the VPI/VCI as
necessary, and sends each cell in the stream out of the
appropriate port and across the NNI to the next switch in the
virtual path.
</p><p>
The last switch within the virtual path for ATM Network 1
repeats this process and sends the cell out through the ICI to
ATM Network 2.
</p><p>
ATM Network 2 continues the process in a similar manner until
the cell is carried through the UNI to the Private ATM Switch
which, in turn, sends the cell to End User 2.  End User 2 then
reconstructs the file from the sequential cells, stripping the
5-byte header from each cell.
</p><p>
End User 1 or End User 2 terminates the call, i.e., "hangs up,"
and the virtual path is dismantled.  The VCI and VPI values
are returned to the pool of available values for each switch.
</p><p>
Notice that only the End Users at either end of the transmission
deal with the 48-byte information load within the cell.  At each
stage of the transmission, the switch is only concerned with
accepting the cell from one port, changing the VPI/VCI according
to its tables, and routing the cell out the appropriate switch
port.
</p><p>
</p><h2>ATM Layered Architecture</h2>
<p>
At the End User sites, ATM operates with a layered structure
that is similar to the OSI 7-layered model.  However, ATM only
addresses the functionality of the two lowest layers of the OSI
model:  the physical layer (Layer 1) and the data link layer
(Layer 2).
</p><p>
All other layers are irrelevant in ATM, as these layers are only
part of the encapsulated information portion of the cell which
is not used by the ATM network.
</p><p>
In ATM, the functionality of the two lower OSI layers are
handled by three layers (shown here below the double line):
</p><p>
</p><pre>.--------------------------------------------------------------,
|   Application Layer                                          |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|   User Layers                                                |
+==============================================================+
|   ATM Adaptation Layer :      Convergence Sublayer           |
|                           -----------------------------------|
|                           Segmentation &amp; Reassembly Sublayer |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|   ATM Layer                                                  |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|   Physical Layer :   Transmission Convergence Sublayer       |
|                      ----------------------------------------|
|                      Physical Medium Dependent Sublayer      |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
</pre>
<p>
The Physical Layer defines the medium for transmission, any
medium-dependent parameters (e.g., rate, quality of service
required), and framing used to find the data contained within
the medium.
</p><p>
The ATM Layer provides the basic 53-byte cell format, by
defining the 5-byte ATM header for each 48-byte payload segment
handed down by the AAL.
</p><p>
The ATM Adaptation Layer (AAL) adapts the higher-level data into
formats compatible with the ATM Layer requirements, i.e., this
layer segments the data and adds appropriate error control
information as necessary.  It is dependent on the type of
services (voice, data, etc.) being transported by the higher
layer.
</p><p>
Several AAL protocols have been defined for specific types of
data.  These are loosely associated with various classes of
data.  However, no AAL is restricted to a specific data class or
type; all types of data could conceivable be handled by any of
the AALs.
</p><dl>
<dt>AAL 1
</dt><dd>Constant bit rate, connection-oriented,
synchronous traffic (e.g., uncompressed voice)
</dd><dt>AAL 2
</dt><dd>Definition never completed undefined, but envisioned to be
for variable bit rate, connection-oriented,
synchronous traffic (e.g., compressed video)
</dd><dt>AAL 3/4
</dt><dd>Variable bit rate, connection-
oriented, asynchronous traffic (e.g., X.25 data)
or connectionless packet data (e.g., SMDS traffic)
with an additional 4-byte header in the
information payload of the cell
</dd><dt>AAL 5
</dt><dd>Similar to AAL 3/4 with a simplified
information header scheme that requires only one
header per data unit and uses the PTI bit (see
below) to indicate the last cell in a transmission
Examples of services that use AAL 5 are
Classic IP over ATM, and LAN Emulation (LANE).
AAL 5 is the most widely used ATM Adaptation Layer Protocol.
</dd></dl>
<p>
See the <a href="http://www.techfest.com/networking/atm/atmaal.htm"> ATM Adaptation Layer Protocols Overview</a>
for more details.
</p><p>
When the End User sends traffic over the ATM network, the
higher-level data unit is passed down to the Convergence
Sublayer of the AAL Layer, which prepares the data for the ATM
Layer according to the designated AAL protocol (when
appropriate).  The data is then passed down to the Segmentation
and Reassembly Sublayer of the AAL Layer, which divides the
prepared data unit into appropriately sized segments.
</p><p>
These segments are then passed down to the ATM Layer, which
defines an appropriate cell header for each segment and
encapsulates the header and payload segment into a 53-byte ATM
cell.
</p><p>
The cells are then passed down to the Physical Layer, which
streams the cells at an appropriate pace for the transmission
medium being used, adding empty cells as needed.
</p><p>
</p><h2>The ATM Cell</h2>
<p>
Each individual ATM cell consists of a 5-byte cell header and 48
bytes of information encapsulated within its payload.  The ATM
network uses the header to support the virtual path and the
virtual channel routing, and to perform a quick error check for
corrupted cells.
</p><p>
The 5-byte header is structured as shown below:
</p><p>
</p><pre>|  8   |  7   |  6   |  5   |  4   |  3   |  2   |  1   |   bits
+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
|  Generic Flow Control*    |  Virtual Path Identifier  |
+---------------------------+---------------------------+
| Virtual Path Identifier   | Virtual Channel Identifier|
+---------------------------+---------------------------+
|               Virtual Channel Identifier              |
+---------------------------+--------------------+------+
|Virtual Channel Identifier |   Payload Type ID  |  CLP |
+---------------------------+--------------------+------+
|                 Header Error Control                  |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
|                  INFORMATION PAYLOAD                  |


  *  For the UNI header only.  The NNI header contains an
     additional 4 bytes of VPI information here instead.
</pre>
<p>
</p><h3>Generic Flow Control (GFC)</h3>
<p>
The GFC field of the header is only defined across the UNI.  It
is intended to control the traffic flow across the UNI and to
alleviate short-term overload conditions.  It is currently
undefined and these 4 bits must be set to 0's.
</p><p>
</p><h3>Virtual Path Identifier (VPI)</h3>
<p>
The VPI, an 8-bit field for the UNI and a 12-bit field for the
NNI, is used to identify virtual paths.  In an idle cell, the
VPI is set to all 0's. (Together with the Virtual Channel
Identifier, the VPI provides a unique local identification for
the transmission.)
</p><p>
</p><h3>Virtual Channel Identifier (VCI)</h3>
<p>
This 16-bit field is used to identify a virtual channel.  For
idle cells, the VCI is set to all 0's.  (Together with the
Virtual Path Identifier, the VCI provides a unique local
identification for the transmission.)
</p><p>
</p><h3>Payload Type Identifier (PTI)</h3>
<p>
The three bits of the PTI are used for different purposes.  Bit
4 is set to 1 to identify operation, administration, or
maintenance cells (i.e., anything other than data cells).
</p><p>
Bit 3 is set to 1 to indicate that congestion was experienced by
a data cell in transmission and is only valid when bit 4 is set
to 0.
</p><p>
Bit 2 is used by AAL 5 to identify the data as Type 0 (beginning
of message, continuation of message; bit = 0) or Type 1 (end of
message, single-cell message; bit = 1) when bit 4 is set to 0.
It may also be used for management functions when bit 4 is set
to 1.
This bit is currently carried transparently through the network
and has no meaning to the end user when AAL 5 is NOT in use.
</p><p>
</p><h3>Cell Loss Priority (CLP)</h3>
<p>
The 1-bit CLP field is used for explicit indication of the
priority of the cell.  It may be set by the AAL Layer to
indicate cells to discard in cases of congestion, or by the
network as part of the traffic management on commercial
subscriber networks.
</p><p>
</p><h3>Header Error Control (HEC)</h3>
<p>
This is an 8-bit cyclical redundancy check computed for all
fields of the first 4 bytes of the ATM cell header ONLY.  It is
capable of detecting all single-bit errors and some multiple-bit
errors.
</p><p>
The HEC is compared by each switch as the ATM cell is received
and all cells with HEC discrepancies (errors) are discarded.
Cells with single-bit errors may be subject to error correction
(if supported or discarded.
</p><p>
When a cell is passed through the switch and the VPI/VCI values
are altered, the HEC is recalculated for the cell prior to being
passed out the port.
</p><p>
</p><h2>Operations and Maintenance Cells (OAM)</h2>
<p>
The Operations and Maintenance (OAM) cells are used to provide
various maintenance functions within the ATM network, including
connectivity verification and alarm surveillance.  These cells
consist of a single segment with an ATM header (as described
above).
</p><p>
The following format for the 48-byte payload:
</p><p>
</p><pre>+----------+----------+-----------------------------+--------+
| OAM Cell | Function |  Function-Specific Fields   | CRC-10 |
|  Type    |   Type   |        (45 Bytes)           |        |
+----------+----------+-----------------------------+--------+
</pre>
<p>
</p><dl>
<dt>OAM Cell Type
</dt><dd>This is a 4-bit indicator of the type of OAM
cell (e.g., 0001 to indicate Fault Management).
</dd><dt>Function Type
</dt><dd>This 4-bit indicator gives the purpose of this
particular OAM cell (i.e., Alarm Indication Signal, Far
End Receive Failure, Loopback).
</dd><dt>Function-Specific Fields
</dt><dd>The 45-bytes of this field are used
specify the functions and information for this particular
cell and to denote destination and failure information.
</dd><dt>CRC-10
</dt><dd>This 2-byte field consists of a 10-bit Cyclical
Redundancy Check for the previous 46 bytes and 6 bits of PAD.
The CRC-10 generating polynomial is:
x<sup>10</sup> + x<sup>9</sup> + x<sup>5</sup> + x<sup>4</sup> +
x + 1.
